# Escape Room

Free to use forever. Currently available in English and Dutch.

## Set up
Admin page where you choose number of groups, the amount of codes and which codes.
Groups can come by during the overview page and click their group to fill in a code.
If correct, their "current code" will go up by one. If incorrect, they will have to guess again.
At the end, when escaped, the overview page will tell them they've escaped.
